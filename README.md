HTML/CSS Week 1 Easier Assignment

I had had some issues at the `<section>` and `<aisle>` area. It took me a while to figure out that I need to add a `<div>` with a .wrapper class to wrap around `<section>` and `<aisle>`. I also add a border to this `<div>` and so it is easier for me to see whether the `<div>` has fully wrapped around `<section>` and `<aisle>`.
